# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose of Analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide some information on what makes a successful theater/play kickstarter. Even though it does not provide the makeup of a great theater/play it does give us insight on what qualities can result in a successful, failed, or canceled theater/play regarding month launched and monetary goal of the kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launched Date: 
Just from looking at the launch month we can clearly see a huge spike in the amount of successful theater kickstarters in the months of May, June, and July which could be due to more people looking to watch a theater during Summer Break. We can also see there does not seem to be a significant difference in the trend of failed kickstarters leading us to believe there must be another factor that is resulting in these kickstarters to be failures. The canceled portion of the graph does not seem to give us any valuable insight outside of the fact that there are not many canceled kickstarter nor do they have a particular trend based on the months.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: 
When looking at the goals chart we have a slightly better look at what constitutes a successful or failed kickstarter. With this data we can see the likelihood of a successful kickstarter increases when there is a lower goal threshold as seen by the graphs and shifts at around the 5000 to 9999 range as indicated by the intersection of the graph. What is interesting is that there seems to be a sudden spike in the percentage of successful kickstarters between the 35000 and 44999 goal range. The likelihood of a successful dramatically decreases as you reach the higher goal amounts. One thing to mention is the lack of canceled kickstarters in the theater/plays section as well as the three intersections on the graph showing that there are more factors in a successful or failed kickstarter than just goal outcome. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
I did not encounter many difficulties outside of hardware issues where Excel would crash because it was unable to filter out criteria efficiently. One aspect that I did find somewhat tedious was having to change the formulas criteria on the Outcome Based on Goals sheet to choose the type of outcome, but that was more of a nuisance than a difficulty. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
The first conclusion that I can make based on the Launch date is that theaters kickstarters generally do better in the summertime than any other month, most likely due to school being out and families having more opportunities to watch theater. We can also conclude that launch date does not have a significant impact on whether a kickstarter is canceled or fails since there are no significant changes on the graph with respect to those aspects. This leads us to believe there must be another driving force behind to what influences a failed or canceled theater kickstarter.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What we can conclude about outcome based purely on goals is that a play kickstarter is more likely to succeed if it has a lower set goal versus if it has a higher one. However, we there seems to be a sweet spot when it comes to making a good kickstarter. We can see from the 35000 to 44999 range that they have high success rates with it suddenly dropping off beyond that point. We can conclude if one wants to create a successful kickstarter they should either have a small goal or have a goal between 35000 to 44999.
- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
I think the biggest limitation of this dataset is the lack of information behind goal. The goal could either simply be set by a company or person or have some significance such as meeting a budget or personal desire. A kickstarter is labeled as successful or a failure by comparing the goal and pledged aspect. We fail to consider the budget of each kickstarter. For example, a theater/play kickstarter could be labeled as a success for having a goal of 1000, making 1100, but taking 2000 to create. We are also comparing many different forms of currency which could cause a problem unless they are all standardized to a single form of currency.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some tables that could be useful to make are tables that spotlight one specific country to easily look at the data in those areas easily. This way we can also see which countries like which forms of entertainment. I also think creating a table or graph to compare the launch dates with their deadlines while comparing their outcome could also be useful in seeing if there is a trend between those aspects.
